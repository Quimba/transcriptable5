Ryan: Yeah, and in the whole process, I guess. Like, proto-typing here, I don't know if that's gotten any easier. 

Colin: We did all of our initial design and everything locally, so we placed it in California, in Sunnyvale ?? surfboards, and I assembled them. By the time we went to China, we had a pretty close product - close being final.
